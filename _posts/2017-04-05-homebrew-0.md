title: Exploring the Homebrew Codebase &#35;0
description: The first of many posts exploring the Homebrew repository
---

Hello, there!

I've decided to write a series of blogs to document my experience of going through the Homebrew/brew repository. Hopefully, it should turn out as a pretty good starting point for someone planning to explore the Homebrew codebase.

For starters, Homebrew is the best package manager for macOS out there. Oh yeah, and it is open source. ( Obligated to mention the unnecessary detail :P )

In any case, do check out the homepage of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

### Prerequisites
Although there is virtually nothing required, the following stuff might help:
- A Mac lying around
- A little bit of programming experience

*Note: I'll sometimes assume that you have brew installed on a Mac, which you have access to. Though you probably would be able to follow me almost completely, having access to a Mac would definitely help.*

### Visiting the Github repository
The repository is available at the following [link](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew). Once you've installed Homebrew on your Mac, you can go to the local repository on your Mac by typing the command `cd $(brew --repository)` on your terminal. This is the same code as that on the online repository I just showed you.

### Basic Homebrew Terminology
Now if you wanna go through with this, then you have to be familiar with Homebrew's usage of certain words.
<dl>
	<dt>Formula :</dt>
	<dd><b>The package definition.</b> Whenever you install something through brew, you run the command <code>brew install software</code>. The software that you wanna install has some processes, which have to be run before it is finally <b>installed</b> on you Mac. This procedural list of processes is a ruby script called a formula.</dd>
	<dt>Keg :</dt>
	<dd><b>The installation prefix of a formula.</b> Once you've run <code>brew install</code> for a formula, you have installed a version of the software. This installation is called a keg. So if you have installed more versions of a software, you have more kegs corresponding to the same formula.</dd>
	<dt>opt prefix :</dt>
	<dd><b>A symlink to the active version of a keg.</b></dd>
	<dt>Cellar :</dt>
	<dt>Tap :</dt>
	<dt>Bottle :</dt>
	<dt>Cask :</dt>
	<dt>Brew bundle :</dt>
