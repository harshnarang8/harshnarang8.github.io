description: The first of many posts exploring the Homebrew repository

Hello, there!

I've decided to write a series of blogs to document my experience of going through the Homebrew/brew repository. Hopefully, it should turn out as a pretty good starting point for someone planning to explore the Homebrew codebase.

For starters, Homebrew is the best package manager for macOS out there. Oh yeah, and it is open source. ( Obligated to mention the unnecessary detail :P )

In any case do check out the homepage of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
